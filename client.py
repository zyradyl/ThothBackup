# Title:        Thoth Backup Client (Python Version)
# Author:       Zyradyl
# Version:      0.01
# Description:  This will eventually be a client for the Thoth Backup System,
#               however it is also my first python project, and an ambitious
#               one. This code is not likely to be the best looking code in
#               the world, but such is life.

print("Hello, World!")
