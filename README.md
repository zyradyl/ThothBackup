## Thoth Backup Service ##

This is a repository for a series of scripts that form a backup service that
I am working on developing. Nothing in here should be considered production
ready. It is likely that most of the server side components will be rewritten
into a single ruby client that will operate based on YAML files.

The various system clients will also be rewritten. You are free to use this
code as you please according to the conditions of the MIT license as indicated
in the LICENSE file.
